            <div class="text">
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The father of white revolution, Dr. On the occasion of the birth centenary of Varghese Kurien, the Indian Dairy Association has announced to celebrate Milk Day nationally to spread the importance of milk in the diet.
                <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, various Dairy Associations, Dairy Professionals, Entrepreneurs and Educational Institutions in the country celebrated the 3rd National Milk Dix on 26th November.
                <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In Ayurveda, the unique importance of milk and dairy products in human diet has been emphasized. Milk is produced from the medicinal essence of many plants. It is absorbent, nutritious and invigorating
                to all animals.
                <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Milk, protein, fats, and carbohydrates, which are essential for the growth and development of the newborn, are all balanced in milk. In addition, it helps in the development of biochemical processes
                It also contains proteins (enzymes), vitamins, phospholipids, cholesterol. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Milk contains mainly casein, lactoalbulin, lactoglobulin proteins. Casein is the main constituent of milk (80%) and is
                in the form of Calcium compound. The protein in cow's milk is highly bio-valuable in terms of ease of growth and growth, making it a very useful food for young children. These proteins contain the right amount of all the amino acids needed
                to nourish the body.
                <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The protein value of buffalo and goat milk is very similar. Due to the smoothness of the milk, especially the fat in it, the milk tastes and smells. Milk contains more than ten fatty acids. Ghee
                stays good for many days due to its oxidizing properties of phospholipids in milk. The fat content of milk is taken into consideration while determining the price of milk.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lactose is the only carbohydrate
                found in milk except milk. Milk sugar is more important for body health. Cow's milk contains 4.9 per cent and buffalo's milk contains 5.2 per cent milk sugar. Sugar is 6 times sweeter than sugar and is a major source of physical energy.
                1 gram of lactose provides 4.1 calories.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Milk and dairy products are rich in minerals and salts, mainly calcium, potassium and phosphorus. Also salts like sodium, magnesium, sulphate etc. are moderate
                while iron, zinc and cobalt. Leukocytes are in very small quantities. The ratio of calcium and phosphorus in milk is 1.3: 1. In addition, milk contains vitamins 'A', 'B-1', 'B-2', 'B-5', 'C', 'D', 'E' and 'K'. It contains high levels of
                thiamine and riboflavin.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Today, India ranks No. 1 in the world in milk production (including 132.4 MT of milk production) and is moving towards economic prosperity. But the relative availability
                of milk and dietary intake of milk and dairy products is very low. So make India strong and resilient by including the right amount of milk and fermented foods in your daily diet.
                <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This milk is concentrated in the condensed milk. The fat content of the milk is reduced to less than 2 microns. Those particles do not come together again as cream. So homogenized milk tastes twenty-four
                sweet.

                    it on low flame. Stir it constantly. Assuming that the khawa is ready when it starts to separate and stick together, the average yield of khawa is 170 to 190 gm from cow's milk and 210 to 230 gm per liter from buffalo's milk. Depends
                    on the things.There are three types of khawi. Different foods are made according to its grade.Pindi khowa- This type of khowa is used for making barfi and pedha. Granulated khowa- This khowa is used for making candy. Khawa- This type
                    of khawa is used for making rose berries. The taste and quality of the food depends on the khawwa used for it. The quality of khawi made using modern machine is excellent and homogeneous. It also saves time.

                    To prepare the sieve, first heat the milk in a stainless steel pan. Normally 80 to 82 degrees centigrade. When the temperature rises, turn off the gas. For one liter of milk, pour a large drop of juice or 2% citric acid solution slowly till the milk breaks
                    up. When the milk is completely broken, the yellow water and solids in it separate. Strain the mixture through a thin muslin cloth and tie it in the same cloth for half an hour. Let the water drain automatically. The fourth layer of
                    milk solids in a muslin cloth is called 'channa *'. One liter of cow's milk yields 220 to 240 gms. A variety of Bengali dishes are made from this basic ingredient. For this, specially made strainer made from cow's milk is used. Cheese
                    The same method of sieving is used to make paneer. Good quality paneer is made from buffalo milk. When it is torn, remove it from the cloth. Then place it in a cloth in a pressure sheet with holes in the bottom or in a wooden box.
                    It should weigh 15 to 20 kg (2 kg per sq. Cm). So that all the water in it will evaporate. Finely chop the prepared paneer and soak it in salt water solution (4 to 5%) for 1 to 2 hours. Then keep the cheese in the fridge for hardness.

                <p>
                    The basic ingredient for making ghee is butter, native butter has at least 76 to 80% fat content. However, in table butter, the proportion should be at least 80%. To make butter, the first cream (cream) is removed from the milk and the cream is bleached.

                    very large. Although different methods are used for the production of ghee, the traditional method of making ghee is to make yoghurt by diluting the milk, removing the butter from the yoghurt or skim milk and washing the butter clean
                    and removing all the buttermilk and then boiling it at the right temperature. And that is to make ghee from it. This method is still widely used in our country today. However, new convenient and more profitable methods have also been
                    developed in ghee production, using the knowledge currently available from new scientific discoveries and experiments, and the newly developed technology. Generally, 1 kg of ghee requires 28 to 29 liters of cow's milk containing 3.5%
                    fat and 8.5% non-fat solids and 16 to 17 liters of buffalo milk containing 6% fat and 9% non-fat solids. Tupat made from cow's or buffalo's milk has a fat content of 99.5%. Thus various dairy products play an invaluable role in our
                    daily diet. These substances are both nutritious and nutritious and also help the human body to absorb nutrients. Spontaneous, These dairy products, which can be made in a simple way, can also help in making them financially strong.
